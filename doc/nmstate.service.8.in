.PP
nmstate\&.service
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
nmstate\&.service invokes \fBnmstatectl service\fR command which
apply all network state files ending with \fB.yml\fR in
\fB/etc/nmstate\fR folder.

.PP
By default, the network state file will be renamed with the suffix
\fB.applied\fR after applying it. This is to prevent it being applied again
when the service runs next.

With \fB/etc/nmstate/nmstate.conf\fR holding below content:

.EX
\fB
[service]\n
keep_state_file_after_apply = true
\fR
.EE

The nmstate.service will not remove network state file, just copy applied
network stata to file with the suffix \fB.applied\fR after applying it.

.PP
By default, nmstate merge network state file with current network state,
if you want to override interface settings without merging, please set
`override_iface = true` in `[service]` section in
\fB/etc/nmstate/nmstate.conf\fR:

.EX
\fB
[service]\n
override_iface = true
\fR
.EE

If `override_iface = true`, for network state to apply, nmstate.service will:

 * For `interfaces` section, any defined interface will be configured by
   desired state information only, undefined properties of this interface will
   use default value instead of merging from current state.

 * For other sections, no changes to their original behavior.

For example, if desired interface has no IPv4 section defined, nmstate
will treat it as disabled regardless current network status.
